# Observer Pattern

- Observer pattern is used when there is one-to-many relationship between objects such as if one object is modified, its depenedent objects are to be notified automatically. 
- It specifies communication between objects: observable and observers. An observable is an object which notifies observers about the changes in its state.

#### Examples 
- JMS (Java Messaging Service)
- MVC Framework (Model is subject and views are observers)
